  - Image upload functionality
- **Accurate Detection**:
  - Binary classification (Good/Defective)
  - Confidence percentage display
- **User-Friendly Interface**:
  - Visual feedback with bounding boxes
  - Adjustable confidence threshold
- **Optimized Performance**:
  - TensorFlow Lite for fast inference
  - Cached model loading

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9
- TensorFlow 2.10
- NumPy 1.24.4
- Streamlit
- OpenCV

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
